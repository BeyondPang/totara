<h1>Total assignments</h1>

<p>The total number of assignments that is displayed in the program
    assignments page and the overview page represents the total number of
    learners in all the assigned categories and not the number of learners
    currently assigned to the program.</p>

<p>If a learner belongs to an organisation that is assigned to the program and
    also holds a position that is assigned to the program then the learner will
    be counted in each category (but will only be assigned to the program once).
