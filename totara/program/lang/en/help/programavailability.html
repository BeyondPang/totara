<h1>Program availability</h1>

<p>This option allows you to "hide" your program
   completely.</p>

<p>It will not appear on any program listings, except to administrators.</p>

<p>Even if students try to access the program URL directly,
   they will not be allowed to enter.</p>

<p>If you set the 'Available from' and 'Available until' dates, students will
    be able to find and enter the program during the period specified by the
    dates but will be prevented from accessing the program outside of those
    dates.</p>
