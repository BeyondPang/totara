<h1>Program/course Categories</h1>

<p>Your Moodle administrator may have set up several
   program/course categories.</p>

<p>For example, "Science", "Humanities", "Public Health" etc</p>

<p>Choose the one most applicable for your program.  This
   choice will affect where your program is displayed on the
   program listing and may make it easier for students to
   find your program.</p>
