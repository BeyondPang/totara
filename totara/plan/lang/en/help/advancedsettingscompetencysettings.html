<h1>Competency Settings</h1>
<p><strong>Competency settings</strong> allow you to define which settings are available for competencies within the plan.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>&lsquo;Due dates&rsquo;</strong> setting. When <strong>&lsquo;Due dates&rsquo;</strong> is set to &lsquo;None&rsquo; the column does not appear on the learning plan.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>&lsquo;Priorities&rsquo; </strong>setting. When you are using <strong>&lsquo;Priorities&rsquo;</strong> you need a <strong>&lsquo;Priority Scale&rsquo;</strong>. Click the dropdown menu to select the priority scale.</p>
<strong> Note: </strong>The option to set up such a scale is in Learning Plans&gt;Priority Scales.
<p><strong>Automatic assignment </strong>enables you to automatically display competencies in a learning plan which have previously been assigned to a user&rsquo;s position or organisation. </p>
<p><strong>Default status</strong> determines the status of a competency when it is is first approved within a plan. If 'Assign newly approved competencies their default status' is checked, all competencies will be given the default status for that competency's scale at the moment the competency is approved. If left unchecked no initial status will be set.
