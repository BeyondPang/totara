TOTARA INSTALL PROCESS
======================

Before installing Totara you should have a server with:
* A supported OS - Linux (Ubuntu 10.04, Debian 6.0, Suse E11, Redhat EL6), Solaris10, other Unix variant
* System clock synchronised with internet time servers.
* Functional outbound email
* Supported webserver software (Apache 2.x.x only at this stage)
* PHP (5.1.6 minimum, 5.3.2 or greater recommended). PHP modules: iconv, mbstring, xmlrpc, ctype, pcre, tokenizer, openssl, gd, and curl
* Access to a supported database (Postgres 8.2 or greater, Mysql 5.0.25 or greater, MSSQL 2008 or greater).
* A domain name that resolves to your server

1. Create directories on your server for www files ('wwwroot' - allow for 1GB) and sitedata files ('sitedata' - allow for 10GB). Ensure the sitedata directory is outside the wwwroot.
2. Configure your webserver to serve requests for your domain from the wwwroot directory.
3. Move the Totara source code into the wwwroot directory.
4. Using your web browser, visit your domain and step through the installation process.
5. Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php every fifteen minutes.
