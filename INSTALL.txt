TOTARA INSTALL PROCESS
======================

Before installing Totara you should have a server with:
* A supported OS - Linux (Ubuntu 10.04, Debian 6.0, Suse E11, Redhat EL6), Solaris10, other Unix variant
* System clock synchronised with internet time servers.
* Functional outbound email
* Supported webserver software (Apache 2.x.x only at this stage)
* PHP (5.1.6 minimum, 5.3.2 or greater recommended). PHP modules: iconv, mbstring, xmlrpc, ctype, pcre, tokenizer, openssl, gd, and curl
* Access to a supported database (Postgres 8.2 or greater, Mysql 5.0.25 or greater, MSSQL 2008 or greater).
* If your database is Postgres we recommend setting standard_conforming_strings to off and escape_string_warning to off (these settings are required for Postgres 9+)
* A domain name that resolves to your server

1. Create directories on your server for www files ('wwwroot' - allow for 1GB) and sitedata files ('sitedata' - allow for 10GB). Ensure the sitedata directory is outside the wwwroot.
2. Configure your webserver to serve requests for your domain from the wwwroot directory.
3. Move the Totara source code into the wwwroot directory.
4. Create an empty database using the UTF8 character set. See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Create_Moodle_site_database for details
5. Using your web browser, visit your domain and step through the installation process.
6. Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php every fifteen minutes.
7. Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron_watcher.php every five minutes.
8. Setting PHP variables
   There are some PHP configuration variables that may need to be customised, depending on your needs. The variables that are commonly changed
   include "memory_limit", "upload_max_filesize" and "post_max_size".
   memory_limit - This will need to be increased for restoring large course backups or unzipping large files within Totara
   upload_max_filesize - This setting in conjuction with "post_max_size" will determine how high you can set the max upload size within Totara.
   These settings are all located in php.ini. See http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php for more information (note that you will need to restart your
   webserver for these settings to take effect).
