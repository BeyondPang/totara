<h1>Cohort profile field values</h1>

<p>If selected, the members of the dynamic cohort will be chosen based on those which have a user profile field matching a particular value.</p>
<p>The values can be a single text string or a comma-separated list of several text strings. If a comma-separated list is provided, users who match any of the individual strings will be included in the cohort.</p>
