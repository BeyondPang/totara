<h1>Cohort type</h1>

<p>The cohort type can be 'set' or 'dynamic'.</p>
<p>Set cohorts are a predefined list of users, manually created by the cohort creator. The creator can add or remove users but otherwise the list is static.</p>
<p>Dynamic cohorts are determined by a rule or set of rules, and the users included in the cohort will dynamically update to include users who match those rules (and remove users who no longer match).</p>
<p>The memebers of a set cohort can be changed at any time, but the rules that define a dynamic cohort cannot be changed once the cohort has been saved.</p>
