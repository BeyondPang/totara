<h1>Plan Permissions</h1>
<p>The advanced workflow settings allows you to define the type of actions which can be performed by learners and managers.  For each type of action there are four permission levels available:</p>
 <ul><li> <strong>Allow</strong> allows the user to perform the action.</li>
  <li><strong>Deny</strong> prevents the user from performing the action.</li>
  <li><strong>Request</strong> allows the user to request that this action is performed.</li>
<li><strong>Approve</strong> allows the user to approve an action.</li></ul>
