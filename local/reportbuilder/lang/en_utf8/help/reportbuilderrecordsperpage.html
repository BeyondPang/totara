<h1>Report Builder: Number of records per page</h1>

<p>
This field determines how many results to show on each page.
</p>
<p>
If there are less records in the report than this number then they will all be shown. If there are more, then the report will be broken up into pages.
</p>
<p>
The higher this number, the longer it will take to display the report page, so we recommend limiting to around 40 records. The maximum number you can select is 5000.
