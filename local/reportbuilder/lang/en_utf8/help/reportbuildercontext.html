<h1>Report Builder: Role Access Context</h1>
<p>In Moodle, roles are assigned in a particular context. This gives the user rights to do certain tasks within that area of the site (see the Moodle Documentation on <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Assign_roles#Contexts">roles</a> for further details).</p>
<p>When choosing which roles can view a report, you can require that the user has the role set in the system context (i.e. at the site-wide level). In many cases however, user roles are assigned at a lower context, for instance a trainer may be assigned as a trainer to a particular course. If that is the case you can choose to let users access the reports if they have the specified role in any context.</p>
