<h1>Report Builder: Sorting</h1>

<p>In general, columns are sorted by individual users by clicking the column headings on the report table.</p>
<p>If you set a default column and sort order via these settings, the data in the report will be sorted by that column initially, until the user sorts for the first time.</p>
<p>Once a user manually sorts the table their new setting will be remembered until the end of their session, at which point it will be reset to the default you selected.</p>
