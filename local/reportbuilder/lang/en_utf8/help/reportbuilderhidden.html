<h1>Report Builder: Hide in My Reports</h1>

<p>If this checkbox is checked, the report will not appear on the My Reports page for any users, even if they have permission to view the report. This can be useful if you want to link to a report from a different location, or temporarily hide a report while you work on it.</p>
<p>Note that the report is still available to any users with permissions to view it at the same URL, only the link is hidden.</p>
<p>If you are expecting your report to appear in My Reports and it is not appearing, even with this box unchecked, the most likely cause is a problem with the access restrictions set on the report.</p>
