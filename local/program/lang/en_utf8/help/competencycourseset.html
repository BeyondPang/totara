<h1>Competency course set</h1>

<p>This set has been created from a predefined competency.</p>

<p>When a competency is used to create a set, it becomes rigid and cannot be changed. Courses within the set cannot be edited. If the courses within this set need to be modified a manual set of courses must be created and courses added individually.</p>

<p>The operator options within a competency course set ('one course' or 'all courses') are determined by the predefined competency settings.</p>
