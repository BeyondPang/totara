<h1>Add program content</h1>

<p>By adding sets of course you can build up the learning path of the program. Once sets are added the relationships between them can be defined. Sets can be created from manually adding courses, selecting a predefined competency or setting up a single course with recurrence.</p>

<p>Once a number of sets have been created, set dividers are employed to allow the creation of sequences (i.e. dependencies) between each set. An example program with four course sets defined could have dependencies as follows:</p>
<ul><li>From set one the learner must complete one course (courseA or courseB) before proceeding to set two.</li>
<li>From set two the learner must complete all courses (courseC and courseD and courseE) before proceeding to set three or set four.</li>
<li>From set three the learner must complete one course (courseE) or all courses from set four (courseF and courseG).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the learning path is completed, the learner has finished the program.</p>

<p>Sets can be created by adding:</p>

<h2>Set of courses</h2>
<p>Allows creation of multiple sets of courses with dependencies. </p>

<h2>Competency</h2>
<p>Allows creation of multiple sets of courses from predefined competency evidence. When a competency is used to create a set, it becomes rigid and cannot be changed.</p>

<h2>Single course</h2>
<p>Forces the allowance of a single course with recurrence.</p>

<p>Once a set of courses or competency is chosen, the single course with recurrence is removed from the list.</p>
