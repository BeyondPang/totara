<h1>Before Activity is Available</h1>
<p><strong>Before activity is available</strong> allows you to set how the restricted activity will display on the course page for learners.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show activity greyed-out, with restriction information:</strong> The learner can see the activity, but is not able to launch the activity until the restriction conditions have been met. The restriction conditions are visible to the learner.</li>
  <li><strong>Hide activity entirely:</strong> The learner will not be able to see the activity until the restriction conditions have been met.</li>
</ul>
