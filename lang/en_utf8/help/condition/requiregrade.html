<h1>Require Grade</h1>
<p>When <strong>Require grade</strong> is enabled the learner must receive a grade for the activity to be marked complete. </p>
<p>You can use the course gradebook to set the passing grade for the activity. When no passing grade has been set up the activity will be marked as complete when the learner receives any grade.</p> 
<h2>Distinguishing between passing and failing grades</h2>
<p>It is possible to set up an activity to allow the learner to see 'completed, passed' or 'completed, fail' instead of the standard 'completed'. These results show a different icon and alternative text.</p>
<p><strong>Setting a passing grade on an activity:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Grades</strong> on the 'Course Admin' block to open the course gradebook</li>
<li>Select <strong>Simple view</strong> under 'Categories and Items' from the 'Choose an action...' dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to the grade item for the activity you wish to set the passing grade for</li>
<li>Click <strong>Show advanced</strong></li>
<li>Set the passing grade value in the 'Grade to pass' field.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>.
</ol>
<p>Once the 'grade to pass' is set the learner will achieve either a 'complete, pass' or a 'complete, fail' when they complete the activity.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> to enable the learner to see 'complete, pass' or 'complete fail' the grades for the activity need to be set to 'immediately visible'. The learner will only see 'completed' otherwise.</p>
