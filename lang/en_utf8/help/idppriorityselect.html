<h1>Competency Scales</h1>
<p>Priority scales enable you to define the criteria by which a priority can be measured. For example, a scale might have three values ‘low, medium, high’.</p>

</p>The first step is to use the Priority scales option to add a new scale, then to add the scale values which are used to define the priority. You can add as many values as you wish. Note also the Default value setting.</p>
