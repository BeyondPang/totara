<h1>Course Tagging</h1>
<p>
Course tagging lets you add any of the moodle 'official' tags to your
course, as a way to classify or identify courses. Offical tags can be
added to the site via the <a href="<? echo
    $CFG->wwwroot ?>/tag/manage.php">Manage Tags</a> page by users with
appropriate permissions.
</p>
<p>
Once configured, course tags can be displayed as columns and used to
filter results within course reports.
</p>
<p>
Course tagging can be disabled at a site-level on the 'Course default
settings' admin page.
