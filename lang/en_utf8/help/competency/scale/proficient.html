<h1>Proficient value</h1>
<p>
Proficient values provide a way for the system to track if a user is 'competent' in a particular competency. This is used to show progress in learning plans and only show overdue notices for incomplete competencies.
<p>
A user is considered 'competent' if the scale value set has 'proficent' checked. You can have multiple scale values set to proficient, but you must have at least one scale value marked as proficient. The proficient value is edited by editing the scale value.
</p>
<p>
The lowest scale value that is marked as proficient is automatically given to any user who has demonstrated the proficiency required by the competency's specified evidence item(s) (e.g., course/activity completion, passing course/activity grade).
