<h1>Types</h1>
<p><strong>Types</strong> provide a way of categorising the individual items within your hierarchies. When you create types you can assign custom fields to them, which allow you to assign metadata to items belonging to that type. Multiple types can be set up within a hierarchy, each with their own set of custom fields. This allow you to create different sorts of items.</p>
<p>When you create a new hierarchy item you can assign it to any of the available types, or leave it as unclassified. If an item is assigned a type, the custom fields defined for that type will then be available when editing the item.</p>
