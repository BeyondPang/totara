<h1>Parent Competency</h1>
<p> <strong>Parent competency</strong> allows you to create parent/child relationships between competencies in the competency framework using depth levels.</p>
<p> Select the <strong>Parent competency</strong> from the dropdown menu. Select <strong>Top</strong> if you want the competency to sit at the top level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>When there is only one depth level set up in the competency framework the parent competency is set at <strong>Top</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>to set up parent/child relationships you need to have at least two depth levels set up.</p>
