<h1>Competency Scale</h1>
<p><strong>Competency scales </strong>enable you to define the criteria by which a competency can be measured. For example, a scale might have three values 'competent, competent with supervision, not competent'.</p>

<p>You must have a competency scale set up before you set up a competency framework, or any competencies.</p>
