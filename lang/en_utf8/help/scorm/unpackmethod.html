<h1>Unpack Method</h1>

<p>If unpack method is set to Manifest, then the associated SCORM/AICC object is expected to be a ZIP file with the appropriate Manifest file inside.  If the unpack method is set to Direct URL, then this URL is assumed to be the launch URL for a single AICC Activity.  A psuedo package will be constructed around this and the communication mode will be assumed to be AICC HACP.
