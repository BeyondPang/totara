<h1>Search hierarchy item</h1>
<p>Enter one or more search terms into the text box and hit search. Any matching results will be shown.</p>
<p>An item will be shown if all of the words typed are found somewhere in the item's name, description or ID number. The search is case-insensitive, so searching for "Competency" will find "COMPETENCY" and "competency".</p>
<p>You can use single (') or double quotes (") to group together a set of words. If grouped, the words must appear in that order.</p>
<p>If you see a pulldown menu, you can use it to limit the results to a single framework or search all frameworks.</p>
