<h1>Parent Position</h1>
<p> <strong>Parent position</strong> allows you to manage parent/child relationships between positions.</p>
<p> Select the <strong>Parent position</strong> from the dropdown menu. Select <strong>Top</strong> if you want the position to sit at the top level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>If you change the parent position of an item it will move to sit below its new parent, and all of its children will move with it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> to set up parent/child relationships you need to have at least one other item in the framework. Otherwise the option will not appear.</p>
