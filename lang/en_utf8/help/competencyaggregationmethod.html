<h1>Aggregation method</h1>
<p>The aggregation method sets how the system will calculate the competency achievement.</p>
<p>If the aggregation method is set to All then all the child competencies will have to be achieved for the parent competency to be declared achieved.</p>
<p>If the aggregation method is set to Any then only one of the child competencies needs to be met to successfully achieve the parent competency (and its related child competencies).</p>
<p>If the aggregation method is set to Off then automatic achievement will be deactivated for this competency. (It may still be marked achieved manually.)</p>
