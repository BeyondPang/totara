<h1>Parent Organisation</h1>
<p> <strong>Parent organisation</strong> allows you to create parent/child relationships between organisations in the organisations framework using depth levels.</p>
<p> Select the <strong>Parent organisation</strong> from the dropdown menu. Select <strong>Top</strong> if you want the organisation to sit at the top level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>When there is only one depth level set up in the organisation framework the parent organisation displays as <strong>Top</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> to set up parent/child relationships you need to have at least two depth levels set up.</p>
