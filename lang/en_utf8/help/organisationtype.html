<h1>Organisation Type</h1>
<p>
Administrators can create and assign types of organisations. If an organisation is assigned a type it inherits any custom fields that have been assigned to that type. This allows you to organise meta-data relating to your organisations and only show the fields that each sort of organisation needs.
