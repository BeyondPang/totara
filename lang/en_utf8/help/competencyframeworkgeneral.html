<h1>Competency Frameworks</h1>
<p><strong>Competency Frameworks </strong>are set up to hold the skills, knowledge and behavioural competencies you expect staff to achieve.</p>
<p>Competencies may be grouped under different kinds of framework. For example, one framework could hold all industry national competency standards (taken from an industry body), while another framework could hold specific competencies set up in-house.</p>
<p>Before you set up a competency framework you must have a <strong>Competency Scale</strong> set up.</p>
