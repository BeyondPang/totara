<h1>Satunnainen kysymys</h1>

<p>Mikäli valitset &quot;Kyllä&quot;, kysymysten järjestys on satunnainen then the order of the
 subquestions
 is randomly shuffled each time a student starts an attempt at a quiz
 containing this question - provided that
 &quot;Shuffle within questions&quot; in
 the Quiz settings is set to &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>

<p>The intention is simply to make it a little harder for students 
   to copy from each other.</p>
